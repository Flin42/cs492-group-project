			Welcome to our interactive CS492 website! This site is dedicated to exploring the impact of digital privacy and the ways our personal data is collected, shared, and exploited. Through this project, we aim to educate users about real-world case studies and data practices, demonstrating how personal data can be compromised and what actions can prevent it.
		</p>
		<p className="mb-8 text-gray-600 text-xl text-justify">
			Our site features an interactive game designed to simulate everyday scenarios where privacy may be at risk. You will navigate fictional (but realistic) situations where you will need to balance convenience, enjoyment, and privacy. Each decision you make comes with trade-offs, and at the end of the experience, you will receive a comprehensive report detailing any personal data leaks and how they occurred. You can play this by pressing the <b>Game</b> tab up top!
		</p>
		<p className="mb-8 text-gray-600 text-xl text-justify">
			There is also thorough write-up that explores the broader context of digital privacy. This section covers the research and real-world scenarios that inspired our gameâ€™s questions, along with related case studies highlighting privacy failures and successes. By connecting these stories to your own experience in the game, we hope to show how real privacy issues are and why they matter. Check it out by pressing the <b>Writeup</b> tab up top!
